## About Koin

Koin is a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin. It allows developers to easily declare and manage dependencies in their applications, providing a simple and concise way to handle dependency injection without the need for boilerplate code.

## Network Caching with OkHttp

OkHttp is used for making network requests, and it provides built-in support for caching responses. By configuring caching with OkHttp, the app can fetch data from the cache when the internet is not available, providing a seamless user experience even in offline mode.
